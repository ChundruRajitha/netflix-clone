# Netflix Clone with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

## Project Overview

This is a Netflix clone project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. The goal of this project is to replicate the basic design and layout of the Netflix homepage, including features such as a navigation bar, homepage banners, movie/TV show sections, and responsive design for mobile and desktop.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system.
- **Navigation Bar**: A fixed navbar similar to Netflix, including logo, search, and user icons.
- **Hero Banner**: A full-width background image with a movie title and description.
- **Movie Sections**: A horizontal scrolling section for movies and TV shows, designed using Bootstrap cards.
- **Bootstrap Components**: Utilized Bootstrap’s built-in classes for a clean and responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page content.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage, including custom styles for layout and design.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used to create responsive designs quickly and easily.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons in the navigation bar (e.g., search icon, user profile icon).
